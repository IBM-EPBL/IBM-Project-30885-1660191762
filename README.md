Project Description:

Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. 
Nowadays new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to 
help people understand their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain 
a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis is the process of determining the nutritional content of 
food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information about the chemical 
composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food.

The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for classifying the fruit 
depends on the different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user can 
capture the images of different fruits and then the image will be sent the trained model. 
The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition based on the fruits like (Sugar, Fibre, 
Protein, Calories, etc.).
